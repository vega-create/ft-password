Many widely believed password practices are outdated, ineffective, or even counterproductive. Security research has evolved significantly, but common advice has not always kept up.

## Myth 1: Change Passwords Every 90 Days

Forced regular password changes often lead to weaker passwords. Users tend to make minimal changes (Password1 becomes Password2) or write passwords down. NIST now recommends against mandatory rotation unless there is evidence of compromise.

## Myth 2: Complex Passwords Are Always Better

A short complex password like "J7#kL9$m" (8 chars) is far weaker than a simple long password like "correcthorsebatterystaple" (25 chars). Length beats complexity for password security.

## Myth 3: Special Characters Make Passwords Uncrackable

Attackers know about common substitutions. P@$$w0rd is barely harder to crack than Password. The real benefit of special characters comes when combined with sufficient length and randomness.

## Myth 4: Never Write Passwords Down

Writing passwords in a physical notebook kept in a secure location is actually safer than reusing passwords across sites. The real danger is digital storage in plain text files.

## Myth 5: Security Questions Add Protection

Security questions like "mother maiden name" or "first pet" are easily discoverable through social media. Use random answers stored in your password manager instead of real answers.

## Myth 6: Longer Is Always Better

While length is important, a 50-character password of repeated characters (aaaaaa...) is trivially crackable. Length provides security only when combined with randomness.

## Myth 7: Password Strength Meters Are Reliable

Many online password strength meters use simplistic rules. A password like "P@ssword1!" scores well on basic checkers despite being in every attacker wordlist. Use comprehensive checkers that evaluate entropy and pattern recognition.

## Myth 8: Biometrics Replace Passwords

Biometrics are identifiers, not secrets. You cannot change your fingerprint if it is compromised. Biometrics work best as a second factor alongside passwords, not as a replacement.

## Myth 9: Hackers Brute-Force Passwords

Most password attacks use leaked databases, phishing, or credential stuffing — not brute force. Using unique passwords per site and enabling 2FA protects against the most common attack vectors.

## Myth 10: One Strong Password Is Enough

No matter how strong your password is, if you reuse it and one service gets breached, all your accounts are at risk. The combination of unique passwords plus a password manager is the most practical approach to password security.
