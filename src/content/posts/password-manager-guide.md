Password managers have become essential tools for digital security. With the average person maintaining over 100 online accounts, remembering unique strong passwords for each one is impossible without help.

## What Is a Password Manager?

A password manager is software that generates, stores, and auto-fills strong unique passwords for all your online accounts. Your passwords are encrypted and protected by a single master password that only you know.

## How Password Managers Work

When you create a new account or change a password, the password manager generates a strong random password and saves it. When you visit a website, it automatically fills in your credentials. All your passwords are encrypted using your master password as the encryption key.

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Most reputable password managers use zero-knowledge architecture, meaning they cannot access your passwords even if they wanted to. Your master password never leaves your device, and all encryption and decryption happens locally.

## Key Features to Look For

### Cross-Platform Sync

Your passwords should be available on all your devices — desktop, laptop, phone, and tablet. Look for managers that support all major operating systems and browsers.

### Password Generator

A built-in password generator creates strong unique passwords automatically. While our online password generator is great for quick use, having generation built into your manager streamlines the workflow.

### Breach Monitoring

Some managers monitor known data breaches and alert you if any of your accounts have been compromised. This allows you to change affected passwords before attackers can use them.

### Secure Sharing

For families and teams, secure password sharing allows you to share access to accounts without revealing the actual password.

### Emergency Access

Designate trusted contacts who can request access to your passwords in case of emergency, with a configurable waiting period.

## Popular Password Managers

The market offers several reputable options including 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass. Bitwarden stands out as an excellent open-source option with a generous free tier. 1Password is widely regarded for its user experience and family plans.

## Getting Started

Start by installing a password manager and importing any passwords your browser has saved. Then, use the manager to generate new strong passwords for your most important accounts first: email, banking, and social media. Gradually update remaining accounts as you log into them.
